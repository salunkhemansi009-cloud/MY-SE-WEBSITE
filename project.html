          <h3>Automatic street light controller</h3>
          <p>Automatic street light controller
            
            An automatic street lighting system is designed to automatically switch ON the street light alongside the roads or the light lamp just outside our house on the onset of dark weather or switch them off automatically after sunrise or during the light hours.We need to save or conserve energy because most of the energy sources we depend on, like coal and natural gas can't be replaced. Once we use them up, they're gone forever.

Saving power is very important, instead of using the power in unnecessary times it should be switched off. In any city “STREET LIGHT” is one of the major power consuming factors. Most of the time we see street lights are controller has an LDR which is used to detect the ambient light. If the ambient light is below a specific value the lights are turned ON. A light dependent sensors is interfaced to the pic 18f452 microcontroller it is used to track the sun light and when the sensors goes dark the led will be made on and when the sensor founds light the led will be made OFF.It clearly demonstrates the working of transistor in saturation region and cut-off region.

The working of relay is also known Microcontroller and the code is written in c language in MikroC ide, the resulted value can be seen with the help of  UART or LCD display. Automatic Street Light Control System is a simple yet powerful concept, which uses transistor as a switch. By using this system manual works are 100% removed. It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes.

This is done by a sensor called Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) which senses the light actually like our eyes. It automatically switches OFF lights whenever the sunlight comes, visible to our eyes.This project exploits the working of a transistor in saturation region and cut-off region to switch ON and switch OFF the lights at appropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch.

A street light, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road or walkway, which is turned on or lit at a certain time every night. Modern lamps may also have light-sensitive photocells to turn them on at dusk, off at dawn, or activate automatically in dark weather<strong>Tech:</strong> React, CSS</p>

          <h3>Obstacle Detection for Blind People</h3>
          <p>
            Obstacle detection for blind people uses a combination of wearable devices, such as smart canes, shoes, or glasses, equipped with sensors (ultrasonic, infrared, or computer vision) to detect objects in the user's path. This information is then relayed to the user through sensory feedback, such as vibrations, sounds, or speech, to provide guidance and improve safety and independence.  
Types of Devices
Smart Canes:
These devices integrate sensors into a traditional white cane, providing information about ground-level and suspended obstacles through tactile or auditory feedback. 
Wearable Devices:
Other wearable technologies include obstacle-detecting shoes, glasses, and even personal electronic devices that can be worn on the body. 
Smartphone-Based Systems:
These systems leverage smartphone cameras and sensors for computer vision-based object recognition, often supplemented with AI algorithms like YOLO to identify obstacles and provide verbal cues via text-to-speech engines. 
Technologies Used
Sensors:
Ultrasonic Sensors: These are commonly used in canes and other devices to detect the presence and distance of objects in front of the user. 
Infrared Sensors: These can be effective for detecting low-lying obstacles that are difficult for a standard cane to sense. 
Computer Vision: Modern systems employ cameras and advanced algorithms to recognize and locate objects in real-time video feeds, providing more detailed information about the environment. 
Feedback Mechanisms:
Vibrations: Devices can create vibrational feedback directly on the user's hand, foot, or body to indicate the presence and distance of an obstacle. 
Audio Alerts: Buzzers and speech modules are used to provide simple beep patterns or spoken instructions about the detected obstacles. 
Microcontrollers and Processing:
Microcontrollers like an Arduino process the raw sensor data and control the output to the feedback mechanisms. 
How It Works
Detection: Sensors on the device scan the environment in front of or around the user. 
Processing: The data from the sensors is sent to a microcontroller or smartphone for analysis. 
Feedback: Based on the analysis, the system generates an alert through vibrations, beeps, or spoken words, informing the user about the nature, size, and distance of the obstacle. 
Examples and Applications
Guide Cane:
A smart cane that uses ultrasonic sensors and servo motors to guide the user and a joystick to provide directions. 
Obstacle-Detecting Glasses:
These glasses have ultrasonic sensors that detect objects and provide a warning through a buzzing sound that intensifies as the object gets closer. 
Wearable Sensors:
Projects include integrating sensors into shoes to detect obstacles at ground level or using a combination of ultrasonic sensors and GPS for outdoor navigation.
