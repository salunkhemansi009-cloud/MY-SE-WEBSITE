          <h3>Automatic street light controller</h3>
          <p>Automatic street light controller
            
            An automatic street lighting system is designed to automatically switch ON the street light alongside the roads or the light lamp just outside our house on the onset of dark weather or switch them off automatically after sunrise or during the light hours.We need to save or conserve energy because most of the energy sources we depend on, like coal and natural gas can't be replaced. Once we use them up, they're gone forever.

Saving power is very important, instead of using the power in unnecessary times it should be switched off. In any city “STREET LIGHT” is one of the major power consuming factors. Most of the time we see street lights are controller has an LDR which is used to detect the ambient light. If the ambient light is below a specific value the lights are turned ON. A light dependent sensors is interfaced to the pic 18f452 microcontroller it is used to track the sun light and when the sensors goes dark the led will be made on and when the sensor founds light the led will be made OFF.It clearly demonstrates the working of transistor in saturation region and cut-off region.

The working of relay is also known Microcontroller and the code is written in c language in MikroC ide, the resulted value can be seen with the help of  UART or LCD display. Automatic Street Light Control System is a simple yet powerful concept, which uses transistor as a switch. By using this system manual works are 100% removed. It automatically switches ON lights when the sunlight goes below the visible region of our eyes.

This is done by a sensor called Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) which senses the light actually like our eyes. It automatically switches OFF lights whenever the sunlight comes, visible to our eyes.This project exploits the working of a transistor in saturation region and cut-off region to switch ON and switch OFF the lights at appropriate time with the help of an electromagnetically operated switch.

A street light, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road or walkway, which is turned on or lit at a certain time every night. Modern lamps may also have light-sensitive photocells to turn them on at dusk, off at dawn, or activate automatically in dark weather<strong>Tech:</strong> React, CSS</p>
